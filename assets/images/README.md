# Images Directory

## Required Images

To complete the visual design of NutriCoach AI, add the following images to this directory:

### Landing Page
- **gym-hero.jpg** (1920x1080px recommended)
  - High-quality gym or fitness image for the hero section
  - Should show people working out, gym equipment, or motivational fitness scenes
  - Will be used as background with overlay

### Suggested Free Image Sources

1. **Unsplash** - https://unsplash.com/s/photos/gym
2. **Pexels** - https://www.pexels.com/search/fitness/
3. **Pixabay** - https://pixabay.com/images/search/workout/

### Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Optimize for web (under 500KB)
- **Resolution**: At least 1920x1080 for hero images
- **License**: Ensure you have rights to use the images

### Optional Images

You can also add:
- Logo image (logo.png)
- Favicon (favicon.ico)
- Profile placeholder (profile-placeholder.png)
- Exercise demonstration images

### Current Setup

The application will work without images, but adding them will significantly improve the visual appeal.

If `gym-hero.jpg` is not found, the hero section will display with just the gradient overlay.
